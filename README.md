VS Ron Version 2.5 is the latest edition of the VS Ron mod which adds in new songs, new animations, new characters, new EVERYTHING. Quite literally, a new **MOD** entirely.

## What's new?

Bijuu Mike or something??? I dont know

# SONGS:
Extra freeplay songs (showcased on kurtfan5468's channel)
Categories to define the songs
Songs have been updated to fit the mod's design choices and objectives more (file manipulation, bloodshed, factory reset, trojan virus, etc.)
NEW Songs

# ANIMATIONS, ART, AND VISUAL APPEAL
All characters have new icons, and some characters have gotten redesigns
Copyright options have been added in to stop copyright claims on videos of people playing the mod, or on streams so content creators DONT get banned
Songs have shaders active in them which can be tweaked freely
Mid song events! Yay! Just a week away, woohoo!
Modcharts have been updated on certain songs, while some have been added or removed from other songs
Custom Fonts
Custom Menus + Better Transitioning
New loading screens, plus better loading screens to tell players what is being LOADED in
Animated stages

# OPTIMIZATION AND CODING
Code has been better optimized to work on more machines effectively
Advanced techniques allow the mod to add extra FUNNIES!

# UI
UI has been drastically changed in the newest update
You can shut off your system within the menu incase you need to for some reason? *no joke we actually did it*

## What's coming?
Nothing much. This update will likely wrap up the mod unless extra bug fixes are needed or something new that can be added in will be added in. Seriously though, in all regards we really appreciate how well the mod is doing, even now with everyone kind of **forgetting** the mod entirely. Thank you all so much for something that has been huge for the past year. :)
